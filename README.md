# Microcontrollers and Microprocessors

This repository contains laboratory programs and foundational implementations in microprocessors and microcontrollers, completed as part of academic coursework.

The focus of this repository is low-level system programming, instruction set understanding, and hands-on experimentation with assembly language and embedded C.

---

## Areas Covered

- Assembly programming (8085 / 8086)
- Register operations and flag manipulation
- Addressing modes and memory handling
- Conditional branching and control flow
- Loop construction in assembly
- Basic embedded C programs for hardware interaction

---

## Tools Used

- GNU Sim8085
- 8086 assembler (lab environment)
- Embedded C toolchain (as per coursework setup)

---

## Purpose

This repository serves as a structured record of system-level programming exercises and hardware-oriented problem solving.

It complements higher-level software development by reinforcing core architectural and low-level concepts.
