# 8085 Microprocessor Programs

This directory contains assembly language programs written for the Intel 8085 microprocessor as part of laboratory coursework.

The programs focus on understanding processor architecture, instruction set usage, flag behavior, and low-level control flow.

---

## Concepts Practiced

- Data transfer instructions
- Arithmetic and logical operations
- Flag manipulation (CY, Z, S, P, AC)
- Addressing modes
- Loop construction using conditional jumps
- Bit rotation and shift operations
- BCD arithmetic using DAA
- Simple control logic implementations

---

## Tools

- GNU Sim8085

---

## Objective

The purpose of these programs is to build a strong foundation in assembly language programming and to understand how high-level logic translates to hardware-level execution.
